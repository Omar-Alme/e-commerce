## FEATURES

Please refer to the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file for all features of the application.

## Design 

TThe application's design adheres to the principles of Material Design, emphasizing simplicity in user interaction. The primary focus is on ease of use, achieved through the intentional design of components to be user-friendly. By adopting a minimalistic approach, the goal was to create a meaningful and purposeful design without unnecessary distractions. Given the multifunctional nature of the application and its numerous components, the strategic use of white spaces was employed to enhance the overall user experience, contributing to a more visually pleasing and intuitive interface.

### Colour Scheme

![Color Schema](documentation/design/color_pallete.png)

In this application, a thoughtfully curated color scheme has been implemented to enhance the user experience. The choice of shades of black for the navigation bar and footer creates a sleek and professional appearance, ensuring optimal readability and visual appeal in these areas.

The white background at the center of the page serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it provides a clean and uncluttered canvas, placing the main content in focus. Secondly, it contributes to a modern and minimalist aesthetic, promoting a sense of simplicity and ease of use for the end user.

Shades of purple have been carefully integrated into buttons and subtext, adding a touch of vibrancy and highlighting key interactive elements. This not only aids in drawing attention to important features but also introduces a visually engaging element to the overall design.

In essence, the chosen color scheme aims to strike a balance between professionalism, user-friendly aesthetics, and a touch of vibrancy for an enriched visual experience.


### Typography

The font used throughout the application is Archivo.

![Typography](documentation/design/font.jpeg)

ARCHIVO was chosen for its modern and clean design, aligning with the application's focus on simplicity and user-friendly aesthetics. Its versatility and readability enhance the overall visual appeal, contributing to a cohesive and contemporary design language.

## Information Architecture

### Database

## Testing 

Please refer back to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for all test-related documentation.

## Deployment 

 - The app was deployed to [Heroku](https://client-management-2b59dd79d4aa.herokuapp.com/)
 - The database was deployed to [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).

### Local Deployment
In order to make a local copy of this project, you can clone it.
In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:

-      git clone https://github.com/Omar-Alme/client-management-app

  - Open the terminal window and type:
  - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

1. Install the dependencies:

    - Open the terminal window and type:
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`


2. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of the project where you should add env.py and __pycache__ files to prevent the privacy of your secret data.

3. Create a `.env` file. This will contain the following environment variables:

    ```python
    import os

      os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'Add a secret key'
      os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'will be used to connect to the database'
      os.environ['DEBUG'] = 'True'
    ```

    *During the development stage DEBUG is set to True, but it is vital to change it to False.*

4. Run the following commands in a terminal to make migrations: 
    - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. Create a superuser to get access to the admin environment.

### Heroku Deployment

* Set up a local workspace on your computer for Heroku:
    - Create a list of requirements that the project needs to run:
      - type this in the terminal: `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub
    
* Go to [www.heroku.com](www.heroku.com) 
* Log in or create a Heroku account.
* Create a new app with any unique name <name app>.


* Create a Procfile in your local workplace:

    
    This file will will contain the following:
    ```python
        web: gunicorn <name app>.wsgi:application
    ```
    - Commit and push the changes to GitHub.


* Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to Config Vars.


Click on Reveal Config Vars and add the following config variables:

| Key      | Value          |
|-------------|-------------|
| DATABASE_URL | ... | 
| DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | 1 |
| SECRET_KEY | ... |
| PORT | ... |
| DEBUG | ... |

* Copy the value of DATABASE_URL and input it into the .env file and generate a secret key (you may use [Djecrety](https://djecrety.ir/) for secret key generation).
* Create EMAIL_HOST_PASS and EMAIL_HOST_USER with a gmail account and add values to these keys.
* Migrate changes.
* Set debug to False in settings.py
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
* Connect your repository to Heroku.

  

* Deploy the app to Heroku by clicking "Deploy Branch" button. If you want to enable auto-deployment, click "Enable Automatic Deployment".


The deployment process will start.

Click "View build logs" to see the progress of the deployment.


*Due to security updates, Heroku dashboard will not allow you to deploy your app from GitHub. Thus, you need to run the following commands in your terminal:*

| action | terminal command | comment |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------- |
| login to your heroku account | `heroku login -i` | |
| create a new app on heroku | `heroku create NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you haven't created the app before, and then, you can access the app via the Heroku dashboard and set up your config vars.|
| add remote to your local repository | `heroku git:remote -a NAME-OF-YOUR-APP` | if you have already created app on Heroku (before the security updates) and connected it using Heroku dashboard |
| deploy new version of the app | `git push heroku main` | |
| rename app | `git remote rename NAME-OF-YOUR-APP NAME-OF-YOUR-APP-2` | |

**Final Deployment**

* Set debug to False locally + delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from config vars in Heroku dashboard.
* Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
